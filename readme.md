Finance logger application built using TypeScript.

This project is a simple application created to get started with TypeScript and learn the basics.

---

I have learned about the following concepts in TypeScript during this project:

- Compilation
- Types: number, string, boolean, array, object, function, enums, tuples
- Explicit and dynamic types (any)
- Configuring the tsconfig.json file
- Type Aliases
- Function Signitures
- DOM & Type Casting (as)
- Classes in TS
- Access Types in TS (private, public, readonly)
- TS Modules
- Interfaces
- Class Interfaces and refactoring the constructor()
- Generics
- More about Enums and Tuples

The files contain my course notes and example code for each topic (sandbox.ts).
